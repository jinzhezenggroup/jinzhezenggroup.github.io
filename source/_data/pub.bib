    of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and
    radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular
    dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion
    of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the
    creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate
    radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized.
    Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some
    new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present
    work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD
    simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex
    reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level
    understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new
    reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory

             complex chemical systems. Central to the method is the potential energy surface (PES) that can
             describe the breaking and formation of chemical bonds. The development of both accurate and
             efficient PES has attracted significant effort in the past 2 decades. A recently developed deep
             potential (DP) model has the promise to bring ab initio accuracy to large-scale reactive MD
             simulations. However, for complex chemical reaction processes like pyrolysis, it remains
             challenging to generate reliable DP models with an optimal training data set. In this work, a
             data set construction scheme for such a purpose was established. The employment of a concurrent
             learning algorithm allows us to maximize the exploration of the chemical space while minimizing
             the redundancy of the data set. This greatly reduces the cost of computational resources required
             for ab initio calculations. Based on this method, we constructed a data set for the pyrolysis of
             n-dodecane, which contains 35 496 structures. The reactive MD simulation with the DP model trained
             based on this data set revealed the pyrolysis mechanism of n-dodecane in detail, and the simulation
             results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, this data set shows
             excellent transferability to different long-chain alkanes. These results demonstrate the advantages

                energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially
                allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale
                systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly
                reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A
                key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model
                training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator
                (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently
                proposed on-the-fly learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is
                capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models
                in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for
                data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively
                performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports
                various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration,
                Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for
                training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection
                on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and
                cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools,
                including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the
                details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu

         have been hydrothermally synthesized to equip with appealing time-resolved luminescence (TRL). 
         Interestingly, we reveal that they can be readily quenched (“turn off”) via a facile surface 
         coating with bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) polymerized from dopamine (DA), resulting from 
         PDA-triggered TRL resonance energy transfer (TRL-RET). By integrated with the thiol-induced 
         inhibition of PDA formation, an ingenious inorganic–organic hybrid tongue-mimic sensor array is 
         thus unveiled for noninvasive pattern recognition of thiols in biofluids in a TRL-RET-reversed 
         “turn on” format toward healthcare monitoring. The sensing principle is based on the new finding 
         that there are differential inhibitions from thiols against the polymerization of DA with 
         various concentrations. Furthermore, density function theory (DFT) studies excellently prove our 
         sensing principle and experimental results, reinforcing the power of the presented system. More 
         importantly, chiral recognition of varied concentrations and mixtures of cysteine enantiomers 
         using our platform are also been demonstrated, promising its practical usage. This is a novel

    abstract = { We present a fast, accurate, and robust approach for determination of free energy profiles and kinetic isotope effects for RNA 2′-O-transphosphorylation reactions with inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. We apply a deep potential range correction (DPRc) for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of reactions in the condensed phase. The method uses the second-order density-functional tight-binding method (DFTB2) as a fast, approximate base QM model. The DPRc model modifies the DFTB2 QM interactions and applies short-range corrections to the QM/MM interactions to reproduce ab initio DFT (PBE0/6-31G*) QM/MM energies and forces. The DPRc thus enables both QM and QM/MM interactions to be tuned to high accuracy, and the QM/MM corrections are designed to smoothly vanish at a specified cutoff boundary (6 Å in the present work). The computational speed-up afforded by the QM/MM+DPRc model enables free energy profiles to be calculated that include rigorous long-range QM/MM interactions under periodic boundary conditions and nuclear quantum effects through a path integral approach using a new interface between the AMBER and i-PI software. The approach is demonstrated through the calculation of free energy profiles of a native RNA cleavage model reaction and reactions involving thio-substitutions, which are important experimental probes of the mechanism. The DFTB2+DPRc QM/MM free energy surfaces agree very closely with the PBE0/6-31G* QM/MM results, and it is vastly superior to the DFTB2 QM/MM surfaces with and without weighted thermodynamic perturbation corrections. 18O and 34S primary kinetic isotope effects are compared, and the influence of nuclear quantum effects on the free energy profiles is examined. },

             with multiple inexpensive "low-level" reference potentials. The gwTP
             method is a generalization of the weighted thermodynamic perturbation
             (wTP) method developed by Li and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory Comput.
             2018, 14, 5583-5596] that uses a single "low-level" reference
             potential. The gwTP method offers new possibilities in model design
             whereby the sampling generated from several low-level potentials may
             be combined (e.g., specific reaction parameter models that might have
             variable accuracy at different stages of a multistep reaction). The
             gwTP method is especially well suited for use with machine learning
             potentials (MLPs) that are trained against computationally expensive
             ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energies and
             forces using active learning procedures that naturally produce
             multiple distinct neural network potentials. Simulations can be
             performed with greater sampling using the fast MLPs and then corrected
             to the ab initio level using gwTP. The capabilities of the gwTP method
             are demonstrated by creating reference potentials based on the MNDO/d
             and DFTB2/MIO semiempirical models supplemented with the "range-
             corrected deep potential" (DPRc). The DPRc parameters are trained to
             ab initio QM/MM data, and the potentials are used to calculate the
             free energy surface of stepwise mechanisms for nonenzymatic RNA
             2'-O-transesterification model reactions. The extended sampling made
             possible by the reference potentials allows one to identify
             unequilibrated portions of the simulations that are not always evident
             from the short time scale commonly used with ab initio QM/MM
             potentials. We show that the reference potential approach can yield
             more accurate ab initio free energy predictions than the wTP method or
             what can be reasonably afforded from explicit ab initio QM/MM

             of drug molecules containing H, C, N, and O atoms. The
             QD{\ensuremath{\pi}} model is in the form of a quantum
             mechanical/machine learning potential correction
             (QM/{\ensuremath{\Delta}}-MLP) that uses a fast third-order self-
             consistent density-functional tight-binding (DFTB3/3OB) model that is
             corrected to a quantitatively high-level of accuracy through a deep-
             learning potential (DeepPot-SE). The model has the advantage that it
             is able to properly treat electrostatic interactions and handle
             changes in charge/protonation states. The model is trained against
             reference data computed at the {\ensuremath{\omega}}B97X/6-31G* level
             (as in the ANI-1x data set) and compared to several other approximate
             semiempirical and machine learning potentials (ANI-1x, ANI-2x, DFTB3,
             MNDO/d, AM1, PM6, GFN1-xTB, and GFN2-xTB). The QD{\ensuremath{\pi}}
             model is demonstrated to be accurate for a wide range of intra- and
             intermolecular interactions (despite its intended use as an internal
             energy model) and has shown to perform exceptionally well for relative
             protonation/deprotonation energies and tautomers. An example
             application to model reactions involved in RNA strand cleavage
             catalyzed by protein and nucleic acid enzymes illustrates
             QD{\ensuremath{\pi}} has average errors less than 0.5 kcal/mol,
             whereas the other models compared have errors over an order of
             magnitude greater. Taken together, this makes QD{\ensuremath{\pi}}
             highly attractive as a potential force field model for drug discovery.},

             resources and automated workflow management on both cloud and high-
             performance supercomputers. Here we introduce Dflow, an open-source
             Python toolkit designed for scientists to construct workflows with
             simple programming interfaces. It enables complex process control and
             task scheduling across a distributed, heterogeneous infrastructure,
             leveraging containers and Kubernetes for flexibility. Dflow is highly
             observable and can scale to thousands of concurrent nodes per
             workflow, enhancing the efficiency of complex scientific computing
             tasks. The basic unit in Dflow, known as an Operation (OP), is
             reusable and independent of the underlying infrastructure or context.
             Dozens of workflow projects have been developed based on Dflow,
             spanning a wide range of projects. We anticipate that the reusability
             of Dflow and its components will encourage more scientists to publish
             their workflows and OP components. These components, in turn, can be
             adapted and reused in various contexts, fostering greater

             external software's self-consistent field procedure. The

             for the treatment of nuclear quantum effects with semiempirical
